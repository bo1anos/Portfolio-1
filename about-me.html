        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As you read my name is Marvin Bolanos i am 18 year old web developer working,I was raised here in the us
            and in school i never really felt like i was the kind of person to want to go to college or further my education
            but falling into the computer science world changed my mind completely ,some of my favorite things to do are hike and play video games,
            i have hiked all over georgia and some of my recommendations are Blood Mountain, Yonah Mountain, and Black Rock Mountain State Park
        </p>
