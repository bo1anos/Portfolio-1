# Portfolio-1
My protfolio was a real journey into figuring out what I was capable of, To begin with i had made my header and navigation bar which was not too much of a challenge, I than wanted to give my site a easy viewing experience and giving the empployer exactly what they want to look for in a developers page i feel like whichi is putting my projects in their view

After i made my boxes i wanted to explain in short what each box of info would represent, after the boxes full of projects hopefully, i want to have my footer actually be my examplatory of what we did in each project 

I know my project is really bare bones and theres alot i could do like adding hover effects to my boxes and really organizing my content together to be mobile friendly but all in all this is waht I hav
